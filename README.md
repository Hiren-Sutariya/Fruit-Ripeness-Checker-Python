# Fruit Ripeness Checker (Python)

This is a simple Python program that checks the ripeness of a fruit (currently Banana) based on the color entered by the user.  
It is created to practice **if-else conditional statements** in Python.

## 📌 How It Works

- The user enters a fruit name
- The user enters the color of the fruit
- Based on the input, the program displays the fruit condition:
  - Green → Unripe
  - Yellow → Ripe
  - Brown → Overripe

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- User Input
- String methods (`capitalize()`, `lower()`)
- Nested `if-elif-else` statements
- Basic Python syntax
